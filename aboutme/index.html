    <h2>Christian Zuniga (Chris)</h2>
        <p>I live in the small town of Los Fresnos, Texas. It is located in the souithernmost tip of Texas, about 10 miles from the border with Mexico. All of my family is Mexican and even though i was born in Texas, spanish was my first language.</p>
        <p>I am 28 years old and happily married to my wife Yarenci. Together we have 3 kids, our youngest is our daughter that was both just 3 months ago.</p>
        <p>From 2014-2016, I served in the Cape Verde, Africa mission where I learned portuguse. Immidiately after getting home from the mission, I got a job as an installation technician for a smart home company. I lasted 5 years with them until I found a better opportunity as an electrician at a solar panel company where I currently work</p>
        <p>I am excited to learn web development and further develop my skills. My goal is that by continuing my education, I'll be able to give my family the live I never had.</p>
